## Overview
The IoT Monitoring System is an embedded system designed to monitor various parameters of a machine room, including voltage, current, power, and temperature. It also controls the room temperature by activating a Cooler Fan whenever the temperature increases by 2%. Additionally, the system stores and sends data in real-time to both a local database and an online server using the MQTT protocol.
